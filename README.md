## **Project Overview**

Afforestation Impact Modeling is an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard that helps visualize and quantify the carbon sequestration potential of various tree species over a 20-year period. This project aims to guide planners, environmentalists, and local governments in sustainable reforestation efforts by estimating CO‚ÇÇ capture based on tree species, growth patterns, and survival rates.

The tool leverages **realistic tree growth data** and allows users to simulate different planting scenarios for optimal carbon footprint reduction.

## **Key Features**

* üå≥ **Tree Species Selection:** Choose from 34 tree species for modeling.
* üå± **Dynamic Quantity Input:** Set the number of trees for each selected species.
* üìä **Interactive Charts:**
  * Line chart for CO‚ÇÇ sequestration over 20 years per species.
  * Bar chart for total CO‚ÇÇ captured by species.
  * Donut chart showing contribution percentages.
  * Cumulative CO‚ÇÇ area chart over time.
* ‚ôªÔ∏è **Metric Calculations:**
  * Total trees planted
  * Expected survivors
  * Total CO‚ÇÇ captured (20 years)
  * Average CO‚ÇÇ per tree
* üìã **Detailed Data Table:** Shows per-species statistics including lifespan, survival rate, expected survivors, and CO‚ÇÇ captured.
* üì• **Export Option:** Download species analysis as CSV.

## **Dataset**

The dataset is located in the `dataset/tree-species.json` file and includes **34 tree species**. Each species contains:

* Average biomass per year
* Carbon content ratio
* CO‚ÇÇ conversion factor
* Survival rate
* Lifespan (years)
* CO‚ÇÇ sequestration per year over 20 years

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejasviravikumar/Afforestation-Impact-Modeling.git
cd Afforestation-Impact-Modeling
```

### **2. Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Requirements**

Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project root with the following content:

```text
streamlit>=1.22.0
pandas>=2.1.1
numpy>=1.26.0
plotly>=5.18.0
```

This ensures all necessary libraries for running the app are installed.

---

## **Usage**

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Use the **sidebar** to select tree species and input the number of trees.
* View **metrics**, **interactive charts**, and **cumulative CO‚ÇÇ projections**.
* Download the CSV of your simulation results for further analysis.

## **Impact Modeling Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:** Tree growth curves and carbon fixation rates.
2. **Model Development:** Scripts project biomass and carbon accumulation over time.
3. **Scenario Analysis:** Simulate different planting scales and species mixes.
4. **Results Presentation:** Interactive visualization of CO‚ÇÇ uptake and species contribution.
5. **Policy Brief:** Summarize outcomes for planners and institutional land-use teams.

**Impact Metric:** Estimated metric tons of CO‚ÇÇ sequestered over a 10‚Äì20 year timeline per 100 trees planted (by species).
