# Bonsai: Afforestation Impact Modeling (Prototype)

**Note:** This is a prototype version of the project. The dashboard and backend integration are still in progress.

---

## Project Overview
Bonsai is a data-driven tool designed to model the **impact of afforestation** on CO₂ sequestration. Users can analyze multiple tree species, visualize their carbon capture potential, and develop sustainable planting strategies.

---

## Key Features
- **Tree Selection Interface**: Choose one or more tree species and adjust planting quantities interactively.
- **CO₂ Sequestration Modeling**: Estimates carbon capture using species-specific biomass, survival rates, and CO₂ conversion factors.
- **Visualization**: Displays species-wise CO₂ sequestration, biomass growth, and survival rates via graphs.
- **Dashboard & Reports**: Interactive dashboard with planned **PDF export functionality**.
- **Scalable**: Easily add more tree species or extend analysis to new regions.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, JSX, CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (integration in progress)
- **Data Analysis**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Dataset**: JSON file containing 34 tree species with biomass, survival rates, and CO₂ factors

---

## Current Status
- Pages 1 & 2 (Welcome and Tree Selection) are functional.
- Dashboard generation, PDF export, and backend integration are under development.
- This is a **prototype**, so some features are incomplete or experimental.

---

## Intended Use
This prototype is designed for **researchers, environmental organizations, and students** to explore species-wise CO₂ sequestration and plan sustainable afforestation strategies.
